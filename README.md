# IoT-based-Node-to-Monitor-Air-Pollution
Designed and built an mobile IoT-based node to monitor air quality. The node powered by an ESP-32 was attached to two-wheelers to report real time air quality data indicators such as PM values, temperature and humidity, CO levels and AQI.

The document `Presentation.pdf` contains a summary of the motivation, implementation and results of the project.
